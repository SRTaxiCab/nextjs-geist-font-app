# Progress Record

- Investigated and fixed syntax error in `tests/components/SecurityCenter.test.tsx` related to missing comma in `setTimeout` call.
- Improved stability of the "switches between tabs correctly" test by adding retry logic with delay and increasing timeout.
- Verified other tests related to SecurityCenter component run successfully.
